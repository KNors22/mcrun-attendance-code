    Hi headrunner!
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a friendly reminder to submit today's headrun attendance.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Click <a href= <?= LINK ?> \> here</a> to access the <?= SEMESTER ?> attendance form. Or use the McRUN app to log it. </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Please ignore this message if the headrun has been cancelled or your group has already submitted the attendance
    form.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br>
      Thank you for all your help! McRun only runs because of you.
